            A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versatility and variety. Tacos are generally eaten without utensils, often garnished with salsa, chili pepper, avocado, guacamole, cilantro (coriander), tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.

            The mainstay of the Mexican diet was, and still is, the tortilla, made from corn.  The tradition continues today with little change.  The kernels are cooked with lime to remove the husk and then ground on a stone slab with a grinding stone.  The dough is formed into little round balls and then patted out by hand into thin round cakes or wrapped in a corn husk, the tamale, to then fill and eat.

          <p> The versatility of the tortilla as a wrapper in endless.  They are used for tacos and enchiladas, among native Mexicans, tortillas are commonly used as eating utensils, as a plate as in a tostada, and much more.  In the United States the tortilla is no longer seen as just an ethnic bread.  This is partially due to the increase of the Hispanic population.
